# Scanimage_Analysis
 
After imaging has been collected using the SI_automated script, run these data processing steps in order:

1. PreProcess_Part1 (motion correction, spectral unmixing)
2. Suite2p (neuron segmentation, dF/F and spike extraction)
3. PreProcess_Part2 (TBD: linking neurons between timepoints, IDing cell types, calculating activity levels and tuning curves)
4. Plotting
